# RoadToFAANG

# Day 1 - August 11th, 2020
## Concepts learned: Merge Intervals, Insert Intervals, C++ Syntax
First day of my road to FAANG. Started off with 2 LeetCode questions Merge Interval (Medium) and Insert Interval (Hard). Insert interval uses merge interval code but with a small addition. All that's needed is to first correctly place the new interval into the list and then call merge interval code. I used to do LeetCode in Java but now I am transitioning to C++ so I'm learning the syntax while doing these questions.
