# Road To FAANG

# Day 1 - August 11th, 2020
## Concepts learned: Merge Intervals, Insert Intervals, C++ Syntax
First day of my road to FAANG. Started off with 2 LeetCode questions Merge Interval (Medium) and Insert Interval (Hard). Insert interval uses merge interval code but with a small addition. All that's needed is to first correctly place the new interval into the list and then call merge interval code. I used to do LeetCode in Java but now I am transitioning to C++ so I'm learning the syntax while doing these questions. 


``` 
// To sort a vector<vector<int>> from low to high based on the first element of each vector<int>
sort(v.begin(), v.end(), [](vector<int>& a, vector<int>& b) {
    return a[0] < b[0];
}); 
```

# Day 2-10 - August 12th to August 20th, 2020
Finished up my exams for the Spring 2020 term and also took a few days off to reset myself. Most of the time I spent hanging out with friends, biking to Toronto, and catching up on some sleep. I'm well motivated to start the grind again :)
